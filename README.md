**WordPress Plugin Boilerplate Powered** is a complete foundation for building your WordPress plugins.  
This project started because mainly the WordPress plugin boilerplates available was too minimal for who is building a lot of plugins.  
Every experienced WordPress developers use always the same libraries (or snippets) and with Composer is very easy but at same time follow best practices.  
Choose a library or a snippet and the boilerplate (with the help of the Code Generator) will generate everything without need a manual copy&paste way or look on internet!

## Features

### Libraries and Miscellaneus available

* [Code Generator](https://github.com/WPBP/generator) to start to develop
* Sass support, CoffeScript and Grunt (not mandatory because the generator can remove them)
* Autoload based on Composer but [extended](https://github.com/WPBP/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate-Powered/blob/master/plugin-name/engine/class-initialize.php)
* Tools integrated like [GrumpPHP](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp) (automatically on commit) and [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/) (`php7.2 vendor/bin/phpstan analyze`)
* Many libraries already available (with starter code) for Composer
